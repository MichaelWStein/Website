            <h5>Data for Good</h5>
            <p>Data for Good is a way for people to contribute to the betterment of society using their expertise in data science 
                <a href="https://dataforgood.ca/about-us/"><strong>(DataforGood)</strong></a>. Datathons are one way to reach these goals. In a Datathon, 
                teams work on a problem provided by a client (often an NGO), using data provided by the client and Data for Good. 
                The time for the Datathon is limited (e.g. a Saturday) and at the end, each team presents their solution to the 
                participants and the client.</p>
            <p><strong>My Activities</strong><br />
                <bolder>Preparation for Datathon - Data Cleaning:</bolder><br />
                • Analyzing data sets.<br />       
                • Ensuring that formatting is correct and consistent.<br />
                • Drop rows and columns that contain no information or contain superfluous information.<br />
                • Gather additional information as discussed by the team.<br />
                • Data cleaning is mostly done with Python (Pandas), additional information is gathered with online research and web scraping.<br />       
                <bolder>Participation in Datathons:</bolder><br />
                • Review of available data and the client’s objectives with the team.<br />
                • Review available data sets and select data for further analysis.<br />
                • Analyze data and put a presentation together.<br />
                • Present final results to clients and the other teams.<br />
                • The data is usually provided as *.csv file.<br />
                • For data selection and analysis Python and/or Tableau are used.</p>

            <h5>Example</h5>  
            <p>Identify opportunities for maximizing participation and fundraising for an annual walk, the main fund raiser for<a href="https://kidshelpphone.ca"><strong>Kids Help Phone</strong></a>.</p>
            <p>Large data sets for participants and donors were analyzed with and transformed with Python. Further analysis and visualization was then done with Tableau.
                 The presentation included:<br />
                • Geographic distribution of participants and donors.<br />
                • Identification of ‘virtual walkers’ (walkers that do not join an official walk, but participate in the campaign and do a walk on their own 
                or with friends) as an important participant group.<br />
                • Identification of a data-collection problem – donations to walking teams are not tracked correctly, which makes it impossible to determine the 
                amounts of money raised by walkers participating in these teams.<br />
                • Identification of repeating donors as especially valuable donor groups (donors contributing every year tend to increase their donations each year).</p>
            <p>Several small programs were written in Python (using Jupyter notebook). This was done for several reasons: <br />
                • Due to the large size of the data sets and the time required for some operations, re-running a notebook (which is required for a variety of reasons) 
                needed to be minimized.<br />
                • Other team members could already start working on the prepared files while further analysis was done.<br />
                • The tight schedule did not leave any time for code optimization.<br /></p>

            <p>Relationship between the Code (blue - each circle is one notebook) and Data (green - each circle is one *.csv file) for the project.</p> 
            <p>All data as well as the solutions developed during the Datathons are proprietary. Therefore the code and a detailed presentation of results are not available.</p>
